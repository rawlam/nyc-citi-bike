# 2019 NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Instroduction

New York Citi Bike is the largest bike share program in the US. Collecting data since 2013. In the hypothetical case, no regular reporting is made and city officials have questions about the programs, here are preliminary reports using dashboards from Tableau. 

A link to the full Tableau analysis is [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ronald.lam/viz/2019NYCCitiBikeAnalysis/2019CitiBikeUnderstandingGender).

## Results

## Usage by Age Group

Millennials as the most frequented users, over 60% more than the next closest age group, Gen X. This could be because Gen X, being slightly older than Millennials, could have aged out of cycling with median trip times 11% higher than Millennials. The older generations take significantly less trips as the city streets can be intimidating and only short trips are viable. Gen Z is still quite young and new to the cycling experience, therefore, spend a little more time to get from point A to point B, but could be a growing number of users as they grow older.

## Top 10: End Stations by Age Group

These high use stations indicate the age demographic in these areas. This can aid Citi Bikes in three ways. First, maintenance and checks will need to be implemented more regularly. Second, station expansions may need to be considered. Third, partnerships with local businesses can be fostered to aid programming that can align and/or incentives other age groups.

## Station Usage by Age Group

Millennials occupy large areas off the western coast of Queens and Brooklyn signalling a large population of Millennials in these areas. Gen X is the second largest age group filling out those same areas. Looking at Gen Z, there is a concentration of usage around New York University, its residences just north west and west to the trendy East Village area.

## Station Usage Between March to September

Gen X, particularly aged 50 individuals make great use of the Citi Bikes. Through the months of March to September of 2019, they are the highest users in number of trips. Seeking their feedback will be worthwhile to improve Citi Bike programming and infrastructure for the Bronx and other new areas. Using the dynamic map we can understand the change, from March to September, the stations being used. This will inform action plans on areas in need of additional bikes and stations, as well as bike relocation to rebalance stations.

## Understanding Gendered Usage

On the whole, there is a steady increase in both female and male customers and subscribers. Looking at the User-type chart, it indicates from March to September, female customers have increased over 500% and subscriptions up almost 200%, comparatively to and increase of over 400% and over 150% respectively with males. Another encouraging note, there are almost 20% more female customers than male customers. Although weather doesn't seem to be a big factor as both average trip duration and count of trips directly correlate between male and female populations, one possible reason for the lack of female subscriptions is the unsafe roads and lack of cycling infrastructure. Further understanding of cycle routes by gender start stations can be understood by interacting with the Travel Routes dynamic map.

## Summary

Citi Bike in New York City has proven to be a great program connecting many parts of the city. The program has still many opportunities to grow and improve from increasing advertising to the Gen Z demographic as they are coming of age in independent mobility particularly in the Brooklyn and Queens areas. Looking into the top 10 most frequented stations, we can see insights for station expansions and partnerships with local businesses. The Gen X population can provide feedback necessary to maintain health and improvement of the cycling system from a simply survey. And finally, increasing awareness for road safety and proceeding to improve and build cycling infrastructure along major cycle routes can increase female subscriptions. With these actionable insights, New York City's Citi Bike program can continue be an excellent service for its customers and further establish itself as one of the leading cycling programs in the world.
